            <figcaption id="img-caption">Nelson Mandela was a civil rights leader in South Africa. He fought against
                apartheid, a system where non-white citizens were segregated from whites and did not have equal rights.
                He served 27 years of his life in prison for his struggle for democracy, but became a symbol for his
                people. Later he would become president of South Africa.</figcaption>
